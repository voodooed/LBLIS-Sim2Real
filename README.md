# LBLIS-Sim2Real
Official Implementation - 
"Towards Closing the Sim-to-Real Gap: A Physics-Guided Learning Approach for LiDAR Intensity Simulation."

# We will soon upload the weights of our trained model along with all the detailed instructions for implemetion. 
# The dataset used in this work is [SemanticKITTI](https://semantic-kitti.org/) and [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) for the real domain and [VoxelScape](https://voxel-scape.github.io/dataset/) for the simulated domain
