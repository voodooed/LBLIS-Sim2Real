## ðŸ”— Pretrained Weights

The pretrained model weights used in this work are available at the following link:

- [Download Weights (SharePoint - IIT Kanpur)](https://iitk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/viveka21_iitk_ac_in/Eq_XKNKsVWdFuQHWFq348JMBp2hpWrYDgZqkRXvPeSPqkQ?e=YvFqkk)

### ðŸ’¾ Instructions

1. Download the weights from the above link.
2. Place the downloaded file(s) into a `weights/` directory at the root of this repository:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p weights
   mv /path/to/downloaded_weights.pth weights/


### We will soon upload all the detailed instructions for implementation. 
### The dataset used in this work are [SemanticKITTI](https://semantic-kitti.org/) and [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) for the real domain and [VoxelScape](https://voxel-scape.github.io/dataset/) for the simulated domain
